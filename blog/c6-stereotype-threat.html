                <p>...and I sometimes wonder if I will be viewed through filters of negative stereotyping regarding women in tech, regarding "older" people in tech, regarding culturally different people in tech.</p>

                <p>And I hope I won't.</p>

                <p>"Stereotype threat" refers to a situational predicament in which people are or feel themselves to be at risk of confirming negative stereotypes about their social group (wikipedia). Most people have at least one social identitiy which is negatively stereotyped (i.e. belonging to a certain race, gender, age group, ethnicity, sexual orientation) and they are vulnerable to stereotype threat whne they are in a situation in which the stereotype is relevant.</p>

                <p><h4>What are some of the negative effects of stereotype threat?</h4></p>

                <p>Stereotype threat can lead to self-handicapping strategies like reduced practice time. When people believe that their performance is affected more to something inherent like a social identity (something they can't change) than their abilities, they tend to spend less time practicing. In addition, this belief can also result in giving less values to domains that certain stereotypes are relevant to.</p>

                <p>Stereotype threat also leads to undermining performance. Someone who is vulnerable to this threat in a certain domain, might tend to justify their low or lack of performance by confirming negative stereotypes of their group.</p>

                <p>Who is vulnerable to stereotype threat?</p>

                <p>Studies show that people who identify themselves strongly with a stereotyped group are at higher risk, especially if they wish to perform well. The effect increases when discrimination is expected due to their identification with the negatively stereotyped group.</p>

                <p><h4>So what is the solution?</h4></p>
