                <h2 id="blog_title">"Cogito ergo sum" - Rene Descartes</h2>
                <h3 id="blog_title">Tue Nov 25, 2014</h3>

                <p>An appropriate title for Claude M. Steele's theory of exercising Self-affirmation against Stereotype Threat. Being self-aware and self-affirm one's own values that lead them to happines, fullfilment, or satisfaction is a powerful mindset that protects from performance decrement that typically arise due to stereotype threat. </p>
                <p>When I think of the times I was the happiest and felt most fulfilled and joyful, was when I was in college. I was sharing a house with a friend and her brother (amazing people) during the week, I was practicing ballroom dancing 20 hours a week, and teaching it 10 h/week (5 of those to friends, just because:)), while also playing in MTG tourneys and making sure to practice 8-ball 2-3 hours a week (no, I am not very good at it but I did place 12th in a nationwide college 8-ball tourney, and yes there were only 14 female players:D ). Looking back at those 2 years, I can easily say those years were pretty good years. And when I think about the values, a bunch of them stand out:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Close relationships/family:</strong> This was important. Sharing the wealth, knowledge, and joy just adds to itself. The more (Honest and Open) people to share these with, the more they get.</li>
                  <li><strong>Ambition:</strong>  I loved ballroom dancing, still do. And though it was physically tiring, I never felt "tired". Ambition is like a warm (not burning) fire that warmed me up and just fueled me back up whenever I felt a bit tired. Like Confucius said "Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day."</li>
                  <li><strong>Knowledge & Growth:</strong>  I just love to learn. Especially learn more about things I love, and to grow and expand in the process, mentally, emotionally, and psychologically.</li>
                  <li><strong>Mentorship & Helping others:</strong>  This comes back to sharing, but for me they are more than that. There is a joy I find in sharing what I know so far, and in helping others. </li>
                  <li>And <strong> Freedom</strong>  to do all of these, what I deem right to do.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These values indirectly led to other values which are just as important: The presence of these values increased my Confidence, Inner Harmony, and Serenity. I was Effective (I love efficiency to an extend where I can't stand inefficiency) and thus was Accomplishing much.</p>
                <p>If I had to measure myself how much I try to live up to these values in general now with the following scale:</p>
                <p>Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Close relationships/family  : 5</li>
                  <li>Ambition                    : 4</li>
                  <li>Knowledge & Growth          : 5</li>
                  <li>Mentorship & Helping others : 4</li>
                  <li>Freedom                     : 3</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Writing about the happiest times in my life made me remember, made me re-feel how I felt back then. Looking at the table(s) above, gave me a better perspective about the reasons.</p>
                <p>I <em>know</em> that remembering these values, being aware that I have them and can use them will help mediate stereotype threat if it happens to present itself, and help me in case I feel down at DBC.</p>
                <p>I know, therefore I am.</p>
