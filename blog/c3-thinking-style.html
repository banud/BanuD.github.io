                <h2 id="blog_title">How am I Thinking</h2>
                <h3 id="blog_title">Sun Oct 26th, 2014</h3>
                <p>There are moments in our lives where probably everyone said “Wow, I never thought of it this way!”, or “I don’t understand how you can learn this way. Isn’t it boring/confusing/distracting/monotonous?” or something along this line. And we just moved on.</p>
                <p>DBC added a new level of self-awareness by stopping us exactly there and encouraged us to look into what our learning and thinking styles are.</p>
                <p>Gregorc’s Mind Styles</p>
                <p>Gregorc’s Thinking model organizes how the mind works on two dimensions: First on  “perceptual space,” concrete vs abstract, and “ordering,” sequential vs random. There are four combinations of the strongest perceptual and ordering ability in each individual:</p>
                <p>
                  <ol>
                    <li><span class="bold">Concrete Sequential (CS) Thinkers</span> tend to be based in reality. They process information in an ordered, sequential, linear way.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Abstract Random (AR) Thinkers</span> organize information through reflection, and thrive in unstructured, people-oriented environments.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Abstract Sequential (AS)  Thinkers</span> love the world of theory and abstract thought.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Concrete Random (CR) Thinkers</span> are experimenters.</li>
                  </ol>
                </p>
                <p>I took the test and scored the same in two combinations. Here is what I learned about myself:</p>
                <img src="img/Conc_Rand.png"/>
                <img src="img/Abst_Seq.png"/>
                <p>Repeating the same tasks over and over (kill me now!)</p>
                <p>Having no options (Oh really?)</p>
                <p>Having too little time to deal with a subject thoroughly (time-boxing? but whyyyyyy???)</p>
                <p>Looking at this picture and especially at “What’s hard for them?” shed a lot of light to why at times I am struggling doing something I love: learning and practicing coding. I realize that I need to work on some of the things that come hard to me, both on inter- and intrapersonal levels. And that to do that I need to develop a deeper self-awareness of my inner mechanics. On a more interpersonal level, I realized that understanding other styles: what they need, what they are looking for and what restricts them would allow even better partnerships and pairings to take place.</p>
                <p>Taking this in with a “growth mindset”: I am glad I learned about my areas of development. I’m excited about improving every day!!</p>
