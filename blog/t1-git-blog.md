-- Dev Bootcamp Phase 0 - Week 1 --

Here are some of the important subjects I learned this week:
* Version Control
* Tracking changes with Git
* Benefits of using GitHub to store code

As a seasoned computer user but a very novice programmer, I had never heard of Version Control before I dived into the software programming world. Head first if I may add! I listened to people talking about Git, about their repos on GitHub but couldn't make any out of it, not really, until this week. So here's what I learned:

What's version control?
Version control is a system to track the changes we make to our files. A SCM (Source Control Management) system that has the information of every "save", as well as the ability to revert back to any "version" of our work if needed.

Git is one of the most popular SCM tools used among programmers. It is a program that runs locally on your computer.
The way it works is as follows:
- You have a project you want to work on.
- Through certain commands you tell Git to "Track this project" and of course Git complies.
- Git does that by creating a repository for that file, which is kind of like a seperate place where a reflection of your project lives.From there on, Git has your project under surveillance 24/7.
- Git will track every change you make to your project.
  * And whenever you save your work and you tell Git to "Mark your save", Git takes a snapshot of all those changes (everything added and deleted, line by line) and records them to the repository. These snapshots become the "save points" or "checkpoints" of your project.
- You can ask Git what changes have been done since the last checkpoint. Or what was it that you added 5 checkpoints ago. Git will tell you.
- And in case you need to go back to one of these "checkpoints", you tell Git. And voila, Git makes it happen.
- And as if this wasn't enough, Git can be used when working on a project as a team. It also can track changes done to the same project by other people. All Git needs for that is :
  * That those people have their own Git program on their local machine.
  * That they know the "path" to your repository, so they can tell their Git to "Go connect with her Git and tell it we're in this together and I will be working on the same files".
  * And from there on, their Git will track their changes 24/7, and tell your Git aaaallll about it everytime they send an update request your way.
  * And Git makes it possible for you to look at all the tracked changes, test them, and see if it works with your changes, and decide if you want to merge that update to the project or not!
  * Git makes it possible for teams to work on the same project without stepping on each other codes.
And before you even know it, you love Git. You really do.

Then everything gets even better - you meet GitHub.

Remember how you we talked about how your team members have to know the "path" that leads to the repository on your computer so that they can work on the same project? Well, what if:
- ...there are too many people working on the project and your computer can't handle the workload anymore?
- ...you want even more people to collaborate on your project - let's say, as many as possible?
- ...you don't have the time check  and assses everyone's changes and wish you had a sub-team doing that, but how is that going to happen when your local computer is the go to "path".

So what are you going to do? Tadaaa...GitHub! GitHub is the online USB, Dropbox, Social Networking combined for everything Git. If Git is kind of your local Version Control Manager, and GitHub is the online Hub Version Control Director.

There are many benefits in using GitHub to store your code:
GitHub makes it possible to share your code with anyone in the world with an internet access. Not only that but it provides visibility to your work, enables everyone to learn from each other, and facilitates collaboration. And your code is always with you!

This marks the end of this blog though it's not nearly close to all that I learned in only one week at DBC! Can't wait for what's to come.

Stay tuned!
