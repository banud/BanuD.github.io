                <h3 id="blog_title">Sun Nove 30, 2014</h3>
                <p>I’m a conflict resolution machine. No, really. I’ve always been a major conflict resolver for friends, family, colleagues, friends of friends and colleagues, old, young - solving big conflicts, small conflicts and any in between. I don’t know why and how, but while listening to or observing conflicts, most of the time the reason of them become very apparent right away and slowly a schema of contributing factors like attitudes, words chosen, timing, past experiences takes shape in front of my eyes and I just share this schema with whoever has the conflict, add some factual knowledge about psychology and my two cents, and voila! Sounds pretty good right? And it is in a lot of ways for a lot of reasons , but… there is always a “but”.</p>

                <p>The “but” of this story is that when the conflict is mine and is between me and someone I am close to, the person above, the rational part of me goes on a vacation. Did I say vacation? I mean sabatical. All that "schema forming in front of my eyes", "apparent reason", all goes out the window. And what is left behind is a bundle of mixed emotions and my first inclination is to withdraw. Like they say, the shoemaker's son walks barefoot, and the road of conflict is covered with gravel.</p>

                <p>Knowing that conflicts can never be resolved without the right kind of communication and attitude, I don’t allow myself to withdraw like I used to when I was younger. However, it is still the first response that is triggered which means the underlying reasons still need some work! Reading through Harold Grossman’s Compass of Shame gave me a deeper understanding about the possible reasons and I know most of it boils down to vulnerability. I don’t like being vulnerable. But I also don’t enjoy isolation or the thought of living in a dark insulated world which withdrawers ultimately seem to end up at. Talk about an ultimate conflict to solve;)</p>

                <p>My solution so far is what I do for any problem - take a deep breath, center myself, and just face it. If a conflict arises, I just take a step back, take some time for whatever negative feelings that may have risen to settle, and then just go and talk about it. Empathy, openness and honesty are values dear to me, even more so in my relationships. I make sure that they are the basis of my communication, and therefore there has been no conflict so big that it couldn’t be solved. </p>
