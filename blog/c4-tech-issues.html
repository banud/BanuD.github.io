                <h2 id="blog_title">Getting into the Tech World</h2>
                <h3 id="blog_title">Sun Nov 2nd, 2014</h3>
                <p>One of the issues facing the Tech World is that it is really hard to get your foot in the door. How does a self-learning/practicing non-CS graduate who doesn’t know many people in the industry can start a career as a Software Developer? The answer to that question is: with a lot of effort, trials and errors. Did I mention “a lot of effort”?</p>
                <p>The tech world is a dynamic industry where everything changes, grows, develops by the minute. This characteristic which attracts so many to the field, also makes it really hard to know what is in demand, or will be in the next few years. Questions like “what to learn or focus on?”, “what is expected from a junior developer?”, “how about a web developer?”, “what is QA, what is whitebox testing? blackbox testing?”, “SQL, do I have to know it?” just come right after the other. Even if you are lucky and know a few people in the field you can ask these questions to, you just realize that everyone has their own opinion and there is not really a way to get a solid answer.</p>
                <p>Even if you find your way in the maze of systems, languages and possibilities and figured out what you want to be and the areas to focus on, oh, AND worked hard to create a portfolio and projects, the issue of “do you have enough connections into the industry” arises. It is hard to get a job - any job, even internships - for someone who is just starting, and rumor is it is easier to get into Mordor than getting in the field without knowing someone.</p>
                <p>So what to do?</p>
                <p>Well, first of all, network, network, network. And then network some more. Jessica Rohman, senior content producer at the HR-industry consulting, research and training firm Great Place to Work, says the average referral bonus at companies on its Best Companies to Work For list is $3,600, and the bonus can go up to $20,000—which underscores the importance companies place on hiring employees who are recommended by people they trust. So start knowing people. Use LinkedIn extensively, go to meet-ups, and reach out to your friends.</p>
                <p>Also, work that social-media profile! According to Nicole Williams, a career expert for LinkedIn, one of the secrets of people who always get the job offer is that their social-media profile is almost better than their resume and adds that any job seeker "has to have a digital footprint, or they'll be considered digitally illiterate." So start tweeting, following, blogging, quoraing - have an online presence.</p>
                <p>And then network some more!</p>
