Non-technical, All-personal First Week Blog

I am really excited about being a part of DBC. While applying to the DBC program, never in a million years did I expect enlightenment in interpersonal and intrapersonal aspects and social skills to be a part of the curriculum. I remember hoping that this wasn't just a marketing technique to make the program seem more distinguished than others. Cynical much? Who? Me? Naaaah...

And after Week 1 at Phase 0, I am more glad than ever to be here. If I had to describe my ultimate dream environment of learning, I could pretty much just point to Karim Sheerif's Fireside Chat (http://vimeo.com/85001014) and say "What he said..."

And the best part...my expectations about everything DBC has been exceeded so far. And I have this warm and fuzzy feeling telling me, there is a good chance that this will continue.

Mainly because, this is our kitchen and we will cook the heck out of it!!!
