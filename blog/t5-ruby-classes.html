                <p>Let's assume we want to create a new kind of animal (would've been great if we could do that with Ruby for real!). We want a specific type of animal that can do certain things like flying and running fast, and can change size (methods), and is black like the night  with eyes glowing in the dark (attributes).</p>

                <p>If we wanted only one animal (object) like this we could do that with assigning some values to a variable and writing a bunch of methods. But what if we might decide to have more of the same animal? Especially if they have to be on different files? We would need to create a new variable each time, assigning the same kind of values and write the same methods over and over for each of them. And what's worse is that when we come up with a new method or attribute later on, we would have to visit back every file that has our animal and add the new method to all of them. Uggh...</p>

                <p>Well, thaannkk youuu Ruby for classes! </p>

                <p>Classes in Ruby is a way to group behaviours (methods) and attributes that you'd like certain objects to have.</p>

                <p>Going with our example above (and I think our animal is very much like a Pegasus at this point), let's create a class of Pegasus because let's be honest, they are very cool and soon enough everybody is going to want them!</p>
