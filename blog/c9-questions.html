                <h3 id="blog_title">Sun Dec 7, 2014</h3>
                <p>Asking questions might not come easy at times. However, sometimes it is even harder to answer them. Even more so in coding questions. Questions that are vague or unclear, that are too verbose or too short often leaves people wondering what is really asked (for), and most of the time might turn them off from giving an answer. </p>
                <p>Here are some guidelines to make sure our questions are good questions with a high chance of providing us with helpful and direct answers:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Define what your problem is as specific as possible.</li>
                    <p>Know what kind of help, information you need. A question that is too broad puts off people because they are not sure how to answer your question or how deep they should go in their answer. Even if they did take the time to answer your question, the answer might not help you at all because their assumption of what you ask for might not be what you actually need.</p>
                  <li>Write a title that summarizes the specific problem.</li>
                    <p>Also include appropriate and specific tags that give the reader an idea of the context of the question.</p>
                  <li>Give a concise descritpion of the context.</li>
                    <p>Contexts can significantly change answers that people provide. Make sure to include information such as language version, and relevant software, platform, and/or operating system information. Another very important point is to include any constraints.</p>
                  <li>State your problem.</li>
                    <p>What is going wrong? What are you expecting your code to do? What have you already found/tried? For one thing, this will save people from wasting time spend suggesting these, and you from reading answers about things you already tried. But more importantly it will encourage people to answer, with a higher chance of the right one.</p>
                  <li>Provide a sample code when applicable.</li>
                    <p>Just like a picture worth a thousand words, a sample code could further the understanding of where the problem lies and what the appropriate solution could be. For the sample code to be useful it should be concise, it should demonstrate the problem, and it should be complete.</p>
                  <li>Have correct spelling, grammar, and formatting.</li>
                    <p>Readibility is very important. If you don't take the time to ensure the readibility of your question, why would people take the time to answer it? Furthermore, not all responders will be native speakers and a question that is hard to read will be harder to understand and this might lead them to just skip it.</p>
                </ul>
                <p>Trying to remember all these might seem a bit too much. Here is a trick: The best way to ask questions is to put ourselves in the shoes of listeners/readers. Just imagine you are a knowledgable and very busy person who has no idea about anything about your question. And then just think:</p>
                <p>What would <em>you</em> need to give a good answer?</p>
