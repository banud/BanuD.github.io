                <h3 id="blog_title">Sun Nov 9, 2014</h3>
                <p>Good pairing and feedback practices is one of the main skills that we concentrate on developing while studying at Dev Bootcamp. Like everyone else, I have been part of team studying/working throughout my life so I didn't really thought about it much. However, pair programming and the art of giving feedback turned out to be something really worth working on.</p>

                <p>I found there are many advantages of pair programming. On the technical and mental side, I really enjoy bouncing off ideas of each other, the brainstorming sessions, and research and planning part of it. On the more emotional side, I was surprised to see how inspiring and motivating it could be, especially if my pair and I can connect on some level. And interestingly enough, I realized that establishing that connection is the key factor on whether the pairing will be a good one or not.</p>

                <p>Communication turns out to be the most important part of establishing that connection as well as solving the challenges in the most effective way. And that is also where some frustration kicked in for me a few times. Personally, I am comfortable in being verbal and believe that everything is easier if it is laid out right from the start, and that giving constant mini-feedbacks during the session enhances the experience. For example I'd rather say something like "Can we take a break and step back for a few minutes? I need to think this out before we continue." then getting lost in the process and start staring at the screen. Hence my frustration comes from pairings where my pair is not vocalizing their needs or wants. In those cases, I find myself trying to fill that communication void by asking a lot of questions to see how it is going for them and what they are thinking - which mostly I got very good feedbacks about. However that does require constant effort and sometimes I feel like I end up dominating the session and I really don't want to. I wonder if my pairs feel like I dominated the session or like I didn't give them a chance to voice their thoughts. I like to be direct and I think that too might feel intimidating. And it is terrible to pair with someone intimidating or dominating! I really hope I am not making anyone feel that way.</p>

                <p>I think I do have to work more on how to encourage my pairs to be more verbal, at their own paceand way. Continously asking some questions has worked really well with some, but I still have to develop other ways - more indirect ways, maybe like just letting silent moments be and wait. I wish there were more actionable feedback on this.</p>

                <p>Which brings us to the subject of feedback! Now that is really a roller coaster ride - you get the thrilling highs and the gut wrenching lows, and some present you with that sudden unexpected turn that makes your heart skip a beat.</p>

                <p>The majority of the feedback I received was absolutely helpful. There were some that made me feel like I got this and I learned what was it that I did right. There were some that made me question my pairing abilities, but were very valuable because they gave great insight of what I didn't do as well as I thought, or things that I thought I did but totally missed the spot. Thanks to these, I know that I should keep asking questions, checking in often, but also to get better at realizing when it is that my pair needs a few minutes to theirselves (this is soo hard to do online!). Having said that, I can't wait for the pairings to be in-person, it makes connecting so much easier and real!</p>

                <p>In the end, with all the ups and downs, I think having to pair program and give feedback is very good practice in developing and honing these skills.</p>
